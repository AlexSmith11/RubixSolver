I wanted to use a very easy to understand method for this solution. I am not at all familiar with efficient Rubix cube design, nor how one would design a cube with a solver in mind.

Due to this, I have opted to use the simplest design I can think of using OOP.

I have come across several papers on Rubix cube design, such as: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800058.801107

However, these primarily seem to deal with solving them, not creating one to be used by a human. (Of course I am sure that if I was able to read further I would eat my words, but the recruiter said that I should only spend an hour!)
